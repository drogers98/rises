#The Sun Also Rises. 
###A short story of a morning, a mountain, and life I suppose.

##The Lot.

I step out of the truck. I had lingered longer than usual in the heat and comfort of the Tacoma's cab. Slowly sipping coffee, and listening to the last few words of the book on tape I had been enjoying over the last week, Ernest Hemingway's "The Sun Also Rises." The crisp March air fills my lungs, and the ritual begins. It was cold. But then it was always cold on Teton Pass at 6:30 AM. I turned my headlamp on, and laced up my boots outside, as I always found the confined nature of the trucks cab never quite sufficient for getting them fitted properly. I was still thinking about the last line of the book when I grabbed my worn pack out of the back, and strapped on my battered snowboard. 

>"Yes," I said. "Isn't it pretty to think so?"

What an end. Not shocking, or even touching really, but real. Memories, I suppose, are what we make them. Truth and memories are not always the same.
I finish adjusting my poles, and don my gloves. As I cross the parking lot, another headlamped soul emerges from their Subaru. I nod. No need for words this early, they too know the dance. I stare at the stars above Jackson. I cross the road to the bootpack. My mind wanders.

##The Rythm Begins.

Left, right, left, right. One foot in front of the other is how it goes. It's the dance. The slog. I've danced this dance before, many times. In many ways, I learned this dance in Oklahoma, under the cruel tutelage of the dancing masters Drill Sergeants Foley, and Gonzales. The Fort Sill Shuffle, it was named, as I recall now. With that foundation, I was invited to attend Suarez all over the world, and did for a short time. Korea, Virginia, Montana, Texas, and Iraq. It was in Iraq that the music finally dimmed for me, and I thought little of dancing for a time afterward. I thought of my partners in movement often, and it is of them I am thinking of now. Men like Fred, Murph, Harp, Bailley, and the others. We were brilliant together, we moved like clockwork, we were swift, we were silent, we were deadly. We were men to be feared. We danced silently in the dark, and reigned down destruction. It was a dance of danger, a dance of discomfort. We talked of what would happen when the music stopped. I was not ready.

I reached the first ridge, and looked to my right to see a sliver of golden orange sun reaching what seemed to be no more than inches above, and silhouetting the Hobacks. I force a sip of water. My mind wanders.

##The Rythm Continues.

If the sound of boots crunching up the fresh snow covering the trail was the drum beat, the wind now added into the hum. Left, right, left, right. Still dancing. It was a different dance now though, in my mind. One that had changed over the years. A dance that was now on my terms.

It was a dance I had slowly learned to enjoy again. A dance I had put on in places like West Virginia, the Pacific Northwest, the Wind River Range, and the Tetons. This dance had different rules, different moves, different partners. I was a student again, and eager to learn. Alpine starts, horrible weather, and long days that left you shivering yourself to sleep in the middle of nowhere. These are the cover charges. The chattering of teeth, rather than machine guns now adds to the percussion.

My partners in this new dance have, for the most part, what Hemingway describes as afición. Passion. It's a must.  For this too is a dance of discomfort, a dance frought with danger. It is apparently, the style of movement that suits me. This dance is more artistic, more bold than before. No longer confined to the shadows. Deeds done in the light, for all to see. Even if that is just a line in the snow, or photos from the summit. 

I do my best to spread this passion to all who are interested, but afición is a personal choice. I can take you out, but I can't make you love it. Passion. You have it or you dont. Game recognize game. I have plenty of friends here in the Tetons that have it, like Giles, Jordan, Tyler, Bill, Julia, Mike, and others. None are with me today. They will be out on their own dances soon enough, if they are not already. I wish them good hunting. I will see them soon. I think of Ken, packrafting Alaska with his dog, and smirk to myself.

>"For one who had afición he could forgive anything. At once he forgave me all my friends. Without his ever saying anything they were simply a little something shameful between us, like the spilling open of the horses in bull-fighting."

I reach the steeps. I pause for a moment, and look back. My truck now a speck in the parking lot, I see the long stretch of commuters headed to Jackson, and smile. That will be me soon, but not just yet. I see the Snake River Range basking aglow in orange as the sun rises higher. I turn off my headlamp. My mind wanders.

##Drum Solo.

Onward and upward, I think to myself. Left, right, pole, step, pole, step. There are others on Mt Glory this morning to be sure, but at the moment, I am alone. My own private Wyoming. Not unusual for this hour. I prefer it that way. I wonder if all with real afición do. No one to look after, no one to consult, no one to impress. Is that true freedom, or just romantic bullshit? On my journey onward, and ever upward, who has been left along the way? 

My thoughts turn towards family. Jeff, Maripat, Vance, Julie, and Meg. They have always supported me. I pray they understand. And what of my neices and nephews. Will I be the fun uncle who takes them camping and skiing, or just the weird guy they see over the holidays sometimes. I pray the former. But how is a man ever sure of his legacy. Weird Uncle Dan, in the hills of Wyoming. He doesnt talk much. There are only so many times one can pass on family vacations to go climbing in exotic places with strangers.

Two skiers are descending Twin Slides, obviously a couple. I nod to them silently, they do the same. No need for conversation, they too have afición. It's getting steeper, I collapse my poles a bit, and carry on. My mind wanders.

There have been several failed relationships in my life. Most of them have been my fault. Dancing with women has always been difficult for me it seems. The moves are akwardly different, slightly strange. I am too stingy with my emotions. Things don't have to be rosy all the time, in fact, they shouldn't be. I get that now. Shades of grey in a mind of black and white.

I think back to the ones that mattered. The ones that saw me at my best, and conversly, at my worst. Lauren, Emily, and the others. Most of these partnerships were ended by me. Thats interesting. Whatever reason I gave at the time, it probably wasnt the real one. I know that now. I needed adventure. I needed the cold, the dark, the discomfort, the unknown. I needed to dance.

That some of these women still suffer me as a friend, I am grateful. It is a testament to their high caliber, giving nature. Part of me wants to call, to email, to catch up over drinks. The other part doesnt want to pry. It's none of my damn business anymore, after all. I've chosen a life of chasing storms. 

I crest the ridge above the radio tower. The sky is light. The thin strip of orange is now stratching past the Gros Ventres. I put on my sunglasses, and drive forward. My mind wanders.

##Over the top.

From here on, the going is easy. The panoramic views engulf me, and entire mountain ranges engulfed in the flame of the morning wash over my vision. A pause in the dance. A drink break for the band. The Tetons, the Gros Ventres, the Hobacks, the Snake River Range, and the Big Holes. These names mean nothing to most, but everything to some. No matter how many times I explore them, theres always more. Each foray only succeeds in wetting the appetite for further exploration. It's a drug. An addictive one. I crave the alpine. I need it, more than anything.

I think back to other memorable sunrises, and the band plays on. I think of the first rays of dawn filtering through the trees in West Virginia with some of the best friends I've ever had. I think of the calm solace, and awestruck colors of the sunsets in Hawaii with Lauren and my family. I think of being warmed by the first rays of dawn bivyed on peak 11,300 with Ken in Alaska. I think of watching the sun rise over the Gros Vetres, while huddling for warmth on the lower saddle of the Grand Teton, so many times, with so many friends. I think of the endless sun rises with Fred and the boys in the desert, punctuated by the morning call of the mosque, and the nagging feeling that it might just be your last. 

Would this memory make the list? Probably not. The solo ones never do. You never bring up dancing by yourself. You never remember as vividly. I suppose it doesnt make them any less important though.

I stride past the hut on top. No time. Need to get to work. I set my bag down, and begin the ritual of preparing for descent. It is not something I even really think about anymore I suppose. Belay jacket, prep gear, helmet, goggles, gloves, poles, strap in. The click, click, click of my ratchet straps add another instrument to the band. I stand up, and look around. Not a bad start to Wednesday. I point the nose downhill. My mind clears.
