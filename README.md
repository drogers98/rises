The Sun Also Rises
=====

The Sun Also Rises. A short story of a morning, a mountain, and life I suppose.

The Lot.

I step out of the truck. I had lingered longer than usual in the heat and comfort of the Tacoma's cab. Slowly sipping coffee, and listening to the last few words of the book on tape I had been enjoying over the last week, Ernest Hemingway's "The Sun Also Rises." The crisp March air fills my lungs, and the ritual begins. It was cold. But then it was always cold on Teton Pass at 6:30 AM. I turned my headlamp on, and laced up my boots outside, as I always found the confined nature of the trucks cab never quite sufficient for getting them fitted properly. I was still thinking about the last line of the book when I grabbed my worn pack out of the back, and strapped on my battered snowboard. 

"Yes," I said. "Isn't it pretty to think so?"

What an end. Not shocking, or even touching really, but real. Memories, I suppose, are what we make them. Truth and memories are not always the same.
I finish adjusting my poles, and don my gloves. As I cross the parking lot, another headlamped soul emerges from their Subaru. I nod. No need for words this early, they too know the dance. I stare at the stars above Jackson. I cross the road to the bootpack. My mind wanders.

The Rythm Begins.

Left, right, left, right. One foot in front of the other is how it goes. It's the dance. The slog. I've danced this dance before, many times. In many ways, I learned this dance in Oklahoma, under the cruel tutelage of the dancing masters Drill Sergeants Foley, and Gonzales. The Fort Sill Shuffle, it was named, as I recall now. With that foundation, I was invited to attend Suarez all over the world, and did for a short time. Korea, Virginia, Montana, Texas, and Iraq. It was in Iraq that the music finally dimmed for me, and I thought little of dancing for a time afterward. I thought of my partners in movement often, and it is of them I am thinking of now. We were brilliant together, we moved like clockwork, we were swift, we were silent, we were deadly. We were men to be feared. We danced silently in the dark, and reigned down destruction. It was a dance of danger, a dance of discomfort. We talked of what would happen when the music stopped. I was not ready.

I reached the first ridge, and looked to my right to see a sliver of golden orange sun reaching what seemed to be no more than inches above, and silhouetting the Hobacks. My mind wanders.

The Rythm Continues.

If the sound of boots crunching up the fresh snow covering the trail was the drum beat, the wind now added into the hum. Left, right, left, right. Still dancing. It was a different dance now, in my mind. One that had changed over the years. A dance that was now on my terms.

It was a dance I had learned to enjoy again. A dance I had put on in places like West Virginia, the Pacific Northwest, the Wind River Range, and the Tetons. This dance had different rules, different moves, different partners. I was a student again, and eager to learn. Alpine starts, horrible weather, and long days that left you shivering yourself to sleep in the middle of nowhere. These are the cover charges. The chattering of teeth now adds to the percussion.

My partners in this new dance have, what Hemingway describes as aficion. Passion. It's a must.  For this too is a dance of discomfort, and danger. It is apparently, the style that suits me. This dance is more artistic, more bold than before. No longer confined to the shadows.
